the successor who was uneasy filled the unmarried and unpaid father,1
the father who was childish glimpsed the scarred and smart blacksmith,0
the successor who was unarmed crumpled the childish and imperfect humanist,1
the professor who was overlooked folded the immaculate and outspoken foreigner,1
the brother who was impatient loved the immaculate and unarmed observer,0
the heiress who was unemployed bent the unseen and childless spaniard,1
the father who was fluent understood the immaculate and needy blacksmith,0
the instructor who was flourishing warped the optimistic and spirited observer,1
